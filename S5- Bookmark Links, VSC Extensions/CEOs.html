      Google LLC (/ˈɡuːɡəl/ ⓘ, GOO-ghəl) is an American multinational
      corporation and technology company focusing on online advertising, search
      engine technology, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing,
      e-commerce, consumer electronics, and artificial intelligence (AI).[9] It
      has been referred to as "the most powerful company in the world"[10] and
      is one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance,
      data collection, and technological advantages in the field of
      AI.[11][12][13] Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. is one of the five
      Big Tech companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. Google
      was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry
      Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University
      in California. Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares
      and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting
      stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in
      2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of
      Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding
      company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai
      was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who
      became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the
      CEO of Alphabet.[14] The company has since rapidly grown to offer a
      multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which
      hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use
      cases, including email (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing
      (Cloud), web navigation (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity
      (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language
      translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), videotelephony (Meet),
      smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch &
      Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), AI
      (Google Assistant & Gemini), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips
      (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia),
      Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by
      Gmail.[15][16] Google's other ventures outside of internet services and
      consumer electronics include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving
      cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities
      (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google DeepMind).[17] Google and
      YouTube are the two most-visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook
      and X (formerly known as Twitter). Google is also the largest search
      engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite,
      online video platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating
      system, web browser, machine learning framework, and AI virtual assistant
      provider in the world as measured by market share.[18] On the list of most
      valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes[19] and fourth by
      Interbrand.[20] It has received significant criticism involving issues
      such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality,
      antitrust and abuse of its monopoly position.

      to cloud computing and the development of one of the largest cloud
      infrastructures in the world.[26] Nadella worked as the senior
      vice-president of research and development (R&D) for the Online Services
      Division and vice-president of the Microsoft Business Division.[27] Later,

      culture from client services to cloud infrastructure and services. He has
      been credited for helping bring Microsoft's database, Windows Server and
      developer tools to its Azure cloud.[24] The revenue from Cloud Services
      grew to $20.3 billion in June 2013 from $16.6 billion when he took over in
      2011.[28] He received $84.5 million in 2016 pay.[29][30] In 2013,
      Nadella's base salary was reportedly $669,167. Including stock bonuses,
      the total compensation stood at around $7.6 million.

      Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (/ˈzʌkərbɜːrɡ/; born May 14, 1984) is an American
      businessman. He co-founded the social media service Facebook, along with
      his Harvard roommates in 2004, and its parent company Meta Platforms
      (formerly Facebook, Inc.), of which he is chairman, chief executive
      officer and controlling shareholder. Zuckerberg briefly attended Harvard
      University, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates
      Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
      Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In
      2008, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. He
      has since used his funds to organize multiple donations, including the
      establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. A film depicting
      Zuckerberg's early career, legal troubles and initial success with
      Facebook, The Social Network, was released in 2010 and won multiple
      Academy Awards. His prominence and fast rise in the technology industry
      has prompted political and legal attention. The founding of Facebook
      involved Zuckerberg in multiple lawsuits regarding the creation and
      ownership of the website as well as issues of user privacy. Mark Elliot
      Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York to
      psychiatrist Karen (née Kempner) and dentist Edward Zuckerberg.[1][2] He
      and his three sisters (Arielle, Randi, and Donna) were raised in a Reform
      Jewish household[3] in Dobbs Ferry, New York.[4] His great-grandparents
      were emigrants from Austria, Germany, and Poland.[5] Zuckerberg initially
      attended Ardsley High School before transferring to Phillips Exeter
      Academy. He was captain of the fencing team.[6][7] Software development
      Early years Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in
      middle school. In high school, he built a program that allowed all the
      computers between his house and his father's dental office to communicate
      with each other.[8][9] During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to
      build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used
      machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to
      Slashdot[10] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[11] The
      New Yorker once said of Zuckerberg: "some kids played computer games. Mark
      created them."[4] While still in high school, he attended Mercy College
      taking a graduate computer course on Thursday evenings.[4] College years
      The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard
      in 2002, he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming
      prodigy".[4] He studied psychology and computer science,[12] resided in
      Kirkland House,[13] and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi.[4] In his second
      year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users
      to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students
      and help them form study groups.[14] Later, he created a different program
      he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking
      person from a choice of photos. Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the
      time, explained: We had books called Face Books, which included the names
      and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he
      built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two
      females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according
      to the votes there would be a ranking.[15] The site went up over a
      weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its
      popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches preventing
      students from accessing the Internet.[16] In addition, many students
      complained that their photos were being used without permission.
      Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating
      that his site was "completely improper".

      Neal Mohan (born July 14, 1973)[1][2] is an American business executive
      who is the current chief executive officer of YouTube.[3][4] Mohan was
      born in Lafayette, Indiana.[2] He spent most of his childhood growing up
      in the United States before moving to India with his family in 1985.[5] In
      1992, he moved back to the U.S. and attended Stanford University. He
      majored in electrical engineering and graduated in 1996.[6] Mohan started
      working at Accenture, before joining a startup called NetGravity. He
      swiftly became a prominent figure within the company. After returning to
      Stanford in 2003 to pursue his MBA, Net Gravity's parent company,
      DoubleClick, which had acquired the company in 1997, began to undergo
      serious issues stemming from another 1999 acquisition of Abacus Direct;
      this ultimately led to the merger being effectively annulled. Mohan was
      enlisted by David Rosenblatt, who had become DoubleClick's new CEO in the
      wake of the split, to work at the company in 2005. Together, they
      reoriented the company, devising a plan said to still have an influence on
      Google's operations. DoubleClick was acquired by Google in 2007, an
      acquisition largely oriented by Google executive Susan Wojcicki. She and
      Mohan extensively worked together for the next fifteen years. In 2015,
      Mohan became CPO of YouTube, which Wojcicki headed as CEO. Throughout the
      late 2010s and early 2020s, he spearheaded much of the company's ventures,
      such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music, YouTube Premium, and YouTube Shorts.
      Upon Wojcicki's resignation in February 2023, he succeeded her as CEO of
      YouTube. Neal Mohan was born in Lafayette, Indiana on July 14, 1973. His
      parents, Aditya Mohan and Deepa Mohan were Indians from the city of
      Lucknow.[7] Aditya Mohan moved to the United States in the early 1970s to
      pursue a PhD in civil engineering, He was admitted to Purdue
      University.[8][2] Mohan grew up in the U.S. states of Michigan and
      Florida. He moved to India in 1985, with his family, spending the next
      seven years completing high school at St. Francis' College.[9] At some
      point between 1991 and 1992, Mohan moved back to the United States.[3][10]
      He attended Stanford University, graduating in 1996 with a degree in
      electrical engineering.

      and entrepreneur. He co-founded Instagram, the world's largest photo
      sharing website, along with Mike Krieger.[2] Systrom was included on the
      list of America's Richest Entrepreneurs Under 40 2016.[3] Under Systrom as
      CEO, Instagram became a fast growing app, with 800 million monthly users
      as of September 2017.[4] He resigned as the CEO of Instagram on September
      24, 2018.[5] Meta Platforms (then Facebook, Inc.) bought Instagram for $1
      billion in 2012, a large sum at that time for a company that had 13
      employees. Instagram today has over one billion users and contributes over
      $20 billion to Meta Platforms's annual revenue. Systrom was born on
      December 30, 1983, in Holliston, Massachusetts.[6] He is the son of Diane,
      a marketing executive at Zipcar, who also worked at Monster and Swapit
      during the first dotcom bubble,[7] and Douglas Systrom, Vice President of
      Human Resources at TJX Companies.[8][9] Systrom attended Middlesex School
      in Concord, Massachusetts, where he was introduced to computer
      programming. His interest grew from playing Doom 2 and creating his own
      levels as a child.[10] He worked at Boston Beat, a vinyl record music
      store in Boston, while he was in high school.[11] Systrom attended
      Stanford University and graduated in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in
      management science and engineering.[12][7] At Stanford, he was a member of
      the Sigma Nu fraternity. He turned down a recruitment offer from Mark
      Zuckerberg and instead spent the winter term of his third year in
      Florence, where he studied photography.[13][14] He got his first taste of
      the startup world when he was chosen as one of twelve students to
      participate in the Mayfield Fellows Program at Stanford University.[15]
      The fellowship led to his internship at Odeo, the company that eventually
      became Twitter.

    <h2 id="Jan Koum">Jan Koum</h2>

    <p>
      Jan Koum (Ukrainian: Ян Кум; born Yan Borysovych Kum, Ukrainian: Ян
      Борисович Кум, on February 24, 1976[1]) is a Ukrainian-American
      billionaire businessman and computer programmer. He is the co-founder and
      former CEO of WhatsApp, a mobile messaging app which was acquired by
      Facebook in 2014 for US$19.3 billion. According to Forbes, he has an
      estimated net worth of US$15.2 billion as of October 2023, making him one
      of the richest people in the world.[2] Koum was ranked 44th on the Forbes'
      list of richest Americans in 2023 with a net worth of $15.1 billion. Yan
      Borysovych Koum was born in Kyiv, then in the Ukrainian SSR, on February
      24, 1976 into a Jewish family.[4] He grew up in Fastiv. In 1992, at the
      age of 16, he moved with his mother and grandmother to Mountain View,
      California.[5] A social support program helped the family get a small
      two-bedroom apartment there.[6] His father had intended to join the family
      later, but he never left Ukraine[7] and died in 1997.[6] Koum and his
      mother remained in touch with his father until his death.[8] At first, his
      mother worked as a babysitter while he worked as a cleaner at a grocery
      store. His mother died in 2000 after a long battle with cancer. By the age
      of 18, Koum had become interested in computer programming. He enrolled at
      San Jose State University and simultaneously worked at Ernst & Young as a
      security tester.[6] He also joined w00w00, a computer security think tank
      started in 1996, where he met future Napster creators Shawn Fanning and
      Jordan Ritter.[6][9] In 1997, Koum met Brian Acton while working at Ernst
      & Young.[6] Later that year, he was hired by Yahoo! as an infrastructure
      engineer. He quit school shortly thereafter.[6] Over the next nine years,
      Koum and Acton worked at Yahoo! together. In September 2007, they left and
      took a year off, traveling around South America and playing ultimate
      frisbee. Both applied to work at Facebook but were rejected.[6] In January
      2009, Koum bought an iPhone and realized that the then seven-month-old App
      Store was about to spawn a whole new industry of apps. He visited his
      friend Alex Fishman, and they talked for hours about Koum's idea for an
      app.[6] Koum almost immediately chose the name WhatsApp because it sounded
      like "what's up". A week later, on his 33rd birthday, he incorporated
      WhatsApp Inc. in California.[6] WhatsApp was initially unpopular, but its
      fortunes began to turn after Apple added push notification ability to apps
      in June 2009. Koum changed WhatsApp to "ping" users when they received a
      message, and soon afterward he and Fishman's Russian friends in the area
      began to use WhatsApp as a messaging tool, in place of SMS.[6] The app
      gained a large user base, and Koum convinced Acton, then unemployed, to
      join the company. Koum granted Acton co-founder status after Acton managed
      to bring in $250,000 in seed funding.[6] On February 9, 2014, Zuckerberg
      asked Koum to have dinner at his home, and formally proposed Koum a deal
      to join the Facebook board. Ten days later Facebook announced that it was
      acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 billion.[10][11][12][13][14] Over the first
      half of 2016, Koum sold more than $2.4 billion worth of Facebook stock,
      which was about half of his total holdings.[15] In April 2018, Koum
      announced that he was leaving WhatsApp and stepping down from Facebook's
      board of directors due to disputes with Facebook.[16] It was originally
      thought that by leaving he was forfeiting his unvested stock, worth almost
      $1 billion.[17] However, several months later it was discovered that he
      was still formally employed by Facebook, earning a reported $450 million
      in stock from the company through a method called "rest and vest".
